# CS-108 Project: ChaCuN

This is a project for the course CS108: Pratique de la programmation OO during BA2 at EPFL.  
It is a port of the popular board game _Carcassonne: Hunters and Gatherers_ so that it can be played on pc.
The rules are not explained but can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcassonne:_Hunters_and_Gatherers).

This project falls under fair use as an educational application.
